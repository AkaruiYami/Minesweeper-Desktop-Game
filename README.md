# Minesweeper (MVC) - Jave Swing
An object-oriented clone of the famous Windows game Minesweeper made in Java-Swing Framework following the Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture. Its a stand-alone desktop game which also provides save and load game functionalities. 

The main design focus is the MVC architecture and the decoupled entities. Attention has been given to even minor details in order to make the game look and feel like the original game.  

There is a separate "Executable Game" folder which has the directly executable game file named *Minesweeper.jar* :)

## How to Run
1- Install these:
 * [Java SE Development Kit 8 (JDK 8)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
 * After installing JDK 8, install [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/downloads/)

2- Open NetBeans IDE. Click on File -> Open Project and browse to the downloaded "Code" folder and select it. It will load the NetBeans project. Then you can read the code files or just click on the Run button to start the game.

3- In order to just play the game, there is a file named **Minesweeper.jar** in the "Executable Game" folder. Just double-click it and the game will start.
